  Say goodbye to Hello World!

  The Harbormaster Orb is a simple, yet powerful way to leverage CircleCI to automate the generation of DevOps projects to produce fully 
  functional applications that can be deployed to, tested, and run through your CircleCI pipeline. It includes generating the CircleCI config.yml 
  necessary to execute a pipeline.

  To get started, Register at platform.harbormaster.ai to get your own API token and assign a Personal Git Access Token to ensure uninterrupted 
  secure Git commits by Harbormaster

  Next, create an environmental variable named HARBORMASTER_API_TOKEN on CircleCI and assign it your Harbormaster API token.

  See https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/ for more details on assigning an environment variable.
